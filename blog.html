					<p class="  text-2xl" >
						Ans. DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a fundamental part
						of modern web development, providing a standard way for developers to
						access and manipulate the content, structure, and style of web pages.
						Its purpose is to make it easier to create dynamic, interactive, and
						accessible web applications that can be accessed by a wide range of
						users on different platforms and devices.

						2. How will select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods?
						
					</h2>
					<p class=" text-2xl">
						Ans. To select HTML elements using DOM, there are several DOM methods:
						<ul class="  text-2xl">
							<li> 1.getElementById()</li>
							<li>2. getElementsByClassName</li>
							<li>3. getElementsByTagName()</li>
							<li>4. querySelector</li>
							<li>5. querySelectorAll()</li>
						</ul>

					<h2 class="my-3 text-3xl font-bold">3.What is event bubble?.</h2>
					<p class=" text-2xl ">
						Ans. Event bubbling is a process in which an event that occurs on a particular element also triggers the same event on all its parent elements in the DOM hierarchy. This means that if attach an event handler to a child element, that event will also be triggered on its parent elements in sequence, until it reaches the topmost element, which is typically the document object. This can be useful for handling events on groups of elements. However, you can stop event bubbling at any point in the DOM tree using the event.stopPropagation() method.

					<h2 class="my-3 text-3xl font-bold">4. What is a callback function and why will we use it? .</h2>
					<p class=" text-2xl">
						Ans. A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked by that function at a later point in time.  callback functions provide a powerful mechanism for controlling the flow of execution in a program, allowing functions to be executed in response to specific events or at specific times, and enabling the creation of highly dynamic and responsive applications.
